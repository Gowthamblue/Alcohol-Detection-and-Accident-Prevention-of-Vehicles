The purpose of this project is to develop vehicle accident prevention by method  of alcohol detector in an effort to reduce traffic accident cases based on driving under the influence alcohol.
This type of system is a great safety factor which can be implanted in the steering of the car.
When driver start the ignition system, sensor measures the concentration of  alcohol in to its breath and switch off the ignition system.

When a driver enters the vehicle and attempts to start the engine, the real-time  alcohol detection system is activated.
If the alcohol level detected is within legal limits, the engine is allowed to start, and  the vehicle can be operated as usual.
However, if the alcohol level exceeds the legal limit or if alcohol is detected in the driver's system, the auto cut-off engine system is triggered.
The driver is then notified of the alcohol detection, and the vehicle remains  immobilized until it is safe for operation.
